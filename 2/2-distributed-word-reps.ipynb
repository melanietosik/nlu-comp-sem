    "Here's a basic recipe for building a word $\\times$ word matrix:\n",
    "    \n",
    "0. Define a notion of co-occurrence context. This could be an entire document, a paragraph, a sentence, a clause, an NP â€” whatever domain seems likely to capture the associations you care about.\n",
    "0. Scan through your corpus building a dictionary $d$ mapping word-pairs to counts. Every time a pair of words $w$ and $w'$ occurs in the same context (as you defined it in 1),  increment $d[(w, w')]$ by $1$.\n",
    "0. Using the count dictionary $d$ that you collected in 2, establish your full vocabulary $V$, an ordered list of words types. For large collections of documents, $|V|$ will typically be huge. You will probably want to winnow the vocabulary at this point. You might do this by filtering to a specific subset, or just imposing a minimum count threshold. You might impose a minimum count threshold even if $|V|$ is small &mdash; for words with very low counts, you simply don't have enough evidence to say anything interesting.\n",
    "0. Now build a matrix $M$ of dimension $|V| \\times |V|$. Both the rows and the columns of $M$ represent words. Each cell $M[i, j]$ is filled with the count $d[(w_i, w_j)]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For different designs, the procedure differs slightly. For example, if you are building a word $\\times$ document matrix, then the rows of $M$ represent words and the columns of $M$ represent documents. The scan in step 2 then just keeps track of (_word_, _document_) pairs &mdash; compiling the number of times that _word_ appears in _document_. Such matrices are often used in information retrieval, because the columns are multi-set representations of documents. They are much sparser than the the word $\\times$ word matrices we will work with here. (In my experience, they yield lower-quality lexicons, but others have reported good results with them.)"

After adding +1 to each cell in the co-occurrence matrix, p(x|y) (the context distribution) becomes a flat distribution (rather than a one-hot spiky distribution) while leaving p(x) relatively unchanged, resulting in a smaller PMI value for rare co-occurrences. Empirically, adding +1 to each cell in the matrix from question 1 will decrease the original problematic PMI value from 1.60893804 to 0.91519232, while leaving all the remaining values virtually unchanged (see results above for reference)."

    "The major difference between Euclidean distance and cosine similarity is that the former is purely a distance measure, whereas the latter measures the angle between vectors without taking their magnitude into account. In other words, by using cosine similarity instead of Euclidean distance we are able to remove the effect of mere word count/frequency, which is usually desirable when dealing with documents of different lengths (since two documents of unequal length might still be about the same topic and thus semantically similar). Mathematically, computing the cosine similarity is equivalent to computing the Euclidean distance between normalized unit vectors."
